## Environments

In this documentation, we will explain the three environments available in our application: `dev`, `beta`, and `prod`.

### Dev Environment

The `dev` environment is used for development purposes. It is where developers can test and debug their code before deploying it to production. In this environment, you can experiment with new features, make changes, and fix bugs without affecting the live application.

### Beta Environment

The `beta` environment is a pre-production environment that closely resembles the production environment. It is used for testing the application with a limited number of users or a specific group of testers. This environment allows for more extensive testing and gathering feedback before releasing the application to the general public.

### Prod Environment

The `prod` environment, short for production, is the live environment where the application is deployed and accessible to end-users. This environment is stable and should only contain thoroughly tested and approved code. It is crucial to ensure that any changes made to the application have been thoroughly tested in the `dev` and `beta` environments before deploying to production.
